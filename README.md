# Basic-Pixel-Game-JavaScript-
Created a basic Pixel Game using javascript tools

Using Javascript to track positioning, pixelation and key inputs along with CSS for coloring, overall appearance, aesthetics and style, I created a basic Pixel Game that uses arrow keys to move the main object (Player).
Moves are basic left right and up using arrow keys. JavaScript was also used to simulate gravity and speed of movement for dynamic behaviour
